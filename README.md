Final Round Project

The exercise is:

Implement a small Next.js app (https://nextjs.org), using TypeScript, that consumes the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev) using Axios. Should contain Unit Tests in Jest and @testing-library/react (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). Would like to see also a coverage report generated by Istanbul (hint: it’s a part of Jest). 100% coverage is not necessary, but I’m expecting unit tests for at least the routes and the components within them.

Should contain the following routes:

Listing of People. Clicking on a Person, should show the Person details;
Listing of Planets. Clicking on a Planet, should show the Planet details;
Listing of Species. Clicking on a Species, should show the Species details.
